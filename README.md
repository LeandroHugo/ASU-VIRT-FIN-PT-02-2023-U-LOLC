As the gender wealth gap continues to be a persistent issue, Ellevest, a New York-based financial technology company, has emerged as a leader in empowering women to take control of their financial futures. Founded in 2014 by Sallie Krawcheck, a former Wall Street executive and advocate for women's financial empowerment. The company's vision is to give women the resources and tools they need to take control of their financial lives and bridge the gender wealth gap.

The company was founded when Krawcheck noticed the lack of investment options and financial advice tailored specifically to women. She realized that women face unique financial challenges, including pay disparities, longer lifespans, and career breaks for caregiving. Traditional financial services providers often failed to address these issues and cater to the specific needs of women.

To address this gap, Krawcheck founded Ellevest, which offers a range of investment and financial planning services specifically designed for women. The company's algorithm creates customized investment portfolios based on a **client's financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.** Additionally, Ellevest provides a suite of educational resources and tools to help women improve their financial literacy and make informed investment decisions.

Ellevest is funded by a combination of venture capital and strategic investors. The company has raised over $70 million in funding, with investors including Rethink Impact, PSP Growth, and tennis star Venus Williams. The company has used its funding to expand its services and technology, as well as to support its marketing and growth efforts.

Ellevest has been recognized for its innovative approach to investing and financial planning, as well as its focus on empowering women. The company has received several awards, including being named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies in 2018 and 2019. Ellevest continues to be a leader in the fintech industry, advocating for greater financial equality and accessibility for women.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)


SOLUTIONS AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

Ellevest's unfair advantage is its specific focus on serving women and addressing the unique financial challenges they face.
