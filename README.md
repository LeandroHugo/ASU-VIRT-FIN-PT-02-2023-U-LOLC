## Revive and Confine
 

As the gender wealth gap continues to be a persistent issue, Ellevest, a New York-based financial technology company, has emerged as a leader in empowering women to take control of their financial futures. Founded in 2014 by Sallie Krawcheck, a former Wall Street executive and advocate for women's financial empowerment. The company's vision is to give women the resources and tools they need to take control of their financial lives and bridge the gender wealth gap.

The company was founded when Krawcheck noticed the lack of investment options and financial advice tailored specifically to women. She realized that women face unique financial challenges, including pay disparities, longer lifespans, and career breaks for caregiving. Traditional financial services providers often failed to address these issues and cater to the specific needs of women.

To address this gap, Krawcheck founded Ellevest, which offers a range of investment and financial planning services specifically designed for women. The company's algorithm creates customized investment portfolios based on a client's financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Additionally, Ellevest provides a suite of educational resources and tools to help women improve their financial literacy and make informed investment decisions.

Ellevest is funded by a combination of venture capital and strategic investors. The company has raised over $70 million in funding, with investors including Rethink Impact, PSP Growth, and even tennis star Venus Williams. The company has used its funding to expand its services and technology, as well as to support its marketing and growth efforts.

Ellevest has been recognized for its innovative approach to investing and financial planning, as well as its focus on empowering women. Led by the renowned Sallie Krawcheck - who Fortune Magazine called “the Last Honest Analyst” - Ellevest has received several awards, including being selected by NerdWallet as one of the Best Robo-Advisors in both 2018 and 2019. Ellevest continues to be a leader in the fintech industry, advocating for greater financial equality and accessibility for women."

Ellevest is pioneering a new approach to empower women financially by offering services and educational resources that make financial planning more accessible for all. In a bid to bridge the gender wealth gap, Ellevest has created an investment service specifically tailored to put women first. Nearly 123,000 customers have chosen to make use of the platform, who range from 18 to 106 years old, with the most common user being a 30-something woman who are also saving in her 401(k).

The company's average account size is $8,000, and the company is committed to serving a diverse range of clients. While its core focus is on providing investment and financial planning services to women, a small portion of the business also focuses on higher-net-worth clients, with a "triple-digit" number of accounts holding $1 million or more. This is a demographic that Ellevest's founder, Sallie Krawcheck, did not originally intend to address with the company, but the events of recent years changed her mind.

Ellevest's approach is to use a proprietary algorithm that creates customized investment portfolios based on each client's financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. This tailored approach sets Ellevest apart from traditional financial services providers and has been successful in attracting a diverse range of clients.

In addition to investment management, Ellevest provides educational resources and tools that help women improve their financial literacy and make informed investment decisions. These resources are designed to meet the needs of women across the income spectrum, with a focus on creating greater financial equality and accessibility for all.

Across the board, Ellevest's commitment to empowering women and providing tailored investment and financial planning services has resonated with a diverse range of clients, from young savers to high-net-worth investors. By offering accessible financial planning and investment management services, as well as educational resources that respect and empower women, Ellevest is advocating for greater financial equality and accessibility for women in the fintech industry.


## DECISIONS AND IMBALANCE

Ellevest's unfair advantage is its specific focus on serving women and addressing the unique financial challenges they face. The company's approach to investment and financial planning is tailored to the specific needs of women, with a proprietary algorithm that creates customized investment portfolios based on each client's financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. This tailored approach sets Ellevest apart from traditional financial services providers that often offer one-size-fits-all investment strategies.

Moreover, Ellevest's educational resources and tools are designed specifically to improve women's financial literacy and help them make informed investment decisions. This represents a significant shift from the historical approach of financial services providers, which have often overlooked the importance of financial education.

Ellevest's focus on empowering women and closing the gender wealth gap has resonated with a diverse range of clients, from young savers to high-net-worth investors. While the company has competitors in the fintech industry, Ellevest's specific focus on serving women and addressing their unique financial challenges is what sets it apart. Ultimately, Ellevest's commitment to creating greater financial equality and accessibility for women represents a significant innovation in the financial services industry.

This commitment represents a major innovation in the financial services industry that enables greater accessibility and equality for women in regards to their finances.



The milestone of Ellevest having achieved over $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) highlights their success not only despite the challenging economic climate brought on by the pandemic, but also due to it. Despite U.S. equity funds seeing more than $241 billion in outflows in 2020, Ellevest experienced net positive inflows each week, constituting a testament to their success in providing financial services and opportunities for women during the she-cession.

Robo advising has become a popular and cost-effective alternative to traditional investment advisors, with companies like Ellevest, Betterment, Wealthfront, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services offering solutions that provide users with automated investing advice. Listed are a few transparencies between companies:

* Investing Philosophy: Ellevest focuses on gender-responsive investing and custom portfolios tailored to your goals. This approach is different from Betterment, Wealthfront, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, which all use a more passive approach to portfolio management.

* Fees: Ellevest’s fees are typically transparent and lower than many traditional financial advisors. Additionally, their pricing structure is different from Betterment, Wealthfront, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services.

* Goals-Based Investing: Ellevest's goal-oriented investments target specific timeframes that users can choose in order to help them reach their long-term goals. This approach is different than Betterment, Wealthfront, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, which offer users more general investments but less tailored options.

## NEW HORIZONS

Ellevest could greatly benefit from implementing blockchain technology for both record keeping and transactions. This would not only enable secure data storage, but also provide a layer of transparency to ensure confidentially and trust within the system. Additionally, smart contracts could be written into the chain which would allow for automatic payments and easily enforceable terms agreements. By utilizing this innovative technology, Ellevest will become even more secure, reliable and trustworthy.

Ultimately, Ellevest stands at the helm of financial inclusion, and has delivered impressive results since its inception. By exploring additional products and services to enhance their existing offerings, Ellevest will be well-positioned to continue empowering women across the globe and realise their goal of closing the gender wealth gap.
